    <h2>NAVIGATE YOUR JOURNEY</h2>

<h1> Born a Crime</h1>
  <h5>Stories from a South African Childhood. </h5>
   is a captivating account of growing , up in apartheid-era South Africa,In the first two chapters,<br> 
   Noah skillfully weaves together personal anecdotes with historical context to paint a vivid picture of his life. <br>

   <h4> Chapter 1, Run</h4>
    This chapter describes how Black South Africans were divided into tribes before apartheid  <br>
    officially segregated South Africa by race.  The Zulu and Xhosa tribes had a long history of conflict, <br>
     with the Zulu resisting European invaders with force and the Xhosa seeking to learn <br>
    from Europeans and strategize against their invasion. <br><br>

    Trevor's mother, a devout Christian, took her family to various churches catering <br>
    to different racial demographics, facing logistical challenges along the way.  <br>
    Her unwavering faith and courage saved Trevor's life when a menacing bus driver threatened them. <br>
     This chapter highlights the racial tensions and resilience of South Africans during apartheid. <br>
    
    <h4>Chapter 2,Born a Crime </h4>

     This chapter delves into the complexities of being mixed-race during apartheid. <br>
      Trevor was born during this period,with his mother being Black (Xhosa) and his father white. <br>
      Sexual relationships between races were illegal, and many  mixed-race children were born.  <br><br>
      The Afrikaners, who took over the South African government after British rule ended, <br>
      formalized an advanced system of racial oppression known as apartheid. While South Africa's <br>
      transition from apartheid overshadowed the Rwandan genocide, both countries grappled with <br>
     ethnic divisions and violence. The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF),mainly Tutsi refugees,  <br>
     invaded Rwanda from Uganda, leading to tensions and massacres. <br><br>
    
    As a Rwandan, I can relate to the themes of discrimination, ethnic tensions, and the resilience  <br>
    of ordinary people depicted in "Born a Crime." Our tragic past, including the 1994 genocide,  <br>
    shares similarities with the struggles of South Africans during apartheid. Trevor's narrative is a <br>
     reminder that understanding our shared histories can promote empathy and foster healing across borders. <br>
